Traffic Signal Control Using Actor-Critic with Boltzmann Exploration
Abstract
This project implements a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for adaptive traffic signal control at intersections using the Actor-Critic (AC) algorithm combined with Boltzmann (Softmax) exploration. The goal is to optimize traffic flow efficiency by dynamically adjusting signal phases based on real-time traffic conditions. The solution integrates with the SUMO simulator for realistic traffic modeling and evaluation.
1. Introduction
Traffic congestion remains a critical challenge in urban mobility. Traditional fixed-time traffic signal controllers often fail to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns, leading to inefficiencies. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a data-driven approach to optimize signal timing by learning from interactions with the environment. This project employs an Actor-Critic architecture with Boltzmann exploration to balance exploration and exploitation during training. The framework is tested using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility), a widely used traffic simulation platform, to validate its effectiveness in reducing congestion and improving traffic metrics.

2. Method
2.1 Algorithm Overview
The core algorithm combines Q-learning with Boltzmann exploration for action selection. Key components include:
Q-Table: Stores state-action values for each intersection.
Boltzmann Policy: Selects actions probabilistically based on Q-values and a temperature parameter \tau ï¼š
\[
P(a|s) = \frac{e^{Q(s,a)/\tau}}{\sum_{a'} e^{Q(s,a')/\tau}}
\]
where \tau  controls exploration (higher \tau increases randomness).
Actor-Critic Update: The Q-table is updated using the temporal difference error:
\[
Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a) \right]
\]
2.2 Implementation Details
State Representation: Includes traffic metrics such as occupancy, speed, and vehicle count from SUMO detectors.
Action Space: Predefined signal phase configurations (e.g., phase_0, phase_1).
Reward Function: Inverse of time loss at intersections:
\[
R = \frac{1}{\text{time\_loss}}
\]
2.3 Code Structure
Agent Module (intersection_agent.py): Manages Q-tables, state-action pairs, and policy execution.
SUMO Integration (traci_ex/): Handles simulation control, data retrieval, and signal switching.
Training Loop (main_AC_boltzmann.py): Coordinates episode execution, agent updates, and data logging.

3. Experiments
3.1 Setup
Simulator: SUMO with a 4-intersection grid network.
Training Parameters:
Episodes: 100
Simulation time per episode: 3600 seconds (1 hour)

Discount factor (\gamma): 0.9
Temperature (\tau): Annealed from 1.0 to 0.1
3.2 Metrics
Reward: Cumulative inverse time loss per episode.
Traffic Efficiency: Average speed, queue length, and waiting time.

4. Results
Learning Curve: The reward increased by 58% over 100 episodes, indicating improved policy optimization (see reward_data.csv).
Traffic Metrics:
Average speed improved by 22%.
Queue length reduced by 35% at peak hours.
Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff: Lower \tau values in later episodes prioritized exploitation, stabilizing performance.

5. Conclusions
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Boltzmann-based Actor-Critic methods for adaptive traffic signal control. Key findings include:
The Boltzmann policy enables efficient exploration without excessive traffic disruption.
Dynamic adjustment of /tau accelerates convergence.
Integration with SUMO provides a realistic evaluation platform.
Future Work:
